### 9-divide_and_rule
- Prints the result of dividing the value stored in the environment variable `POWER` by the value stored in `DIVIDE`.

### 10-love_exponent_breath
- Displays the result of raising `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`.

- Converts a number from base 10 (stored in `DECIMAL`) to base 16 and prints the result.

### 101-rot13
- Encodes and decodes text using the ROT13 encryption algorithm.

### 102-odd
- Prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line.
